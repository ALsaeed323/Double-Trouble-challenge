# Double-Trouble-challenge
Challenge Description : An old APK from a defunct covert op sits quiet too quiet. Its surface shows little, almost like a decoy. But agents knew: the true signal only responds to a specific knock. Rumor says if you call... then call again, something buried deep will stir. Can you find the right rhythm to wake it?
